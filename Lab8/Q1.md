# Probability with a Standard Deck of Cards

A standard deck contains **52 cards**, including 4 suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Each suit contains 13 cards, and each has exactly one Jack, Queen, and King (the face cards).

##  Probability of Drawing a Red Card

- **Red cards** include: Hearts  and Diamonds 
- Total red cards = 26  
- Total cards in deck = 52  

**Probability:**  
`P(Red) = 26 / 52 = 1/2 = 0.5` → **50%**

---

## Probability that a Red Card is a Heart

- Total red cards = 26  
- Hearts = 13  

**Conditional Probability:**  
`P(Heart | Red) = 13 / 26 = 1/2 = 0.5` → **50%**

---

##  Probability that a Face Card is a Diamond

- Total face cards (Jack, Queen, King in each suit) = 12  
- Diamond face cards = 3  

**Conditional Probability:**  
`P(Diamond | Face) = 3 / 12 = 1/4 = 0.25` → **25%**

---

##  Probability that a Face Card is a Spade or a Queen

- Face cards that are spades = 3  
- Queens across all suits = 4  
- Overlap (Queen of Spades) = 1  

**Adjusted Probability (Inclusion-Exclusion):**  
`P(Spade or Queen | Face) = (3 + 4 - 1) / 12 = 6 / 12 = 1/2 = 0.5` → **50%**
